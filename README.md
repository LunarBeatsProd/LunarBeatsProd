Important: 

I am neurodivergent, mood swingy and I have severe abandonment issues, anxiety issues and fear of failure I probably also have BPD but I’m still unsure of that.

I don’t like the constant joking about stuff all the time. Call me old fashioned or blunt or whatever you wanna name it lol. Due to being neurodivergent I find it hard to enjoy jokes n stuff as I either don’t understand them or i get the joke/information differently than others so please keep that in mind if possible please.
